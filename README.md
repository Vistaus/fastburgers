Fastburgers is a simple calorie counting app using the Harrisâ€“Benedict equation to track meals and sports activities. It is a fork of [Fatburners](https://gitlab.com/KrilleFear/fatburners) with a [dark mode patch](https://gitlab.com/KrilleFear/fatburners/-/merge_requests/7) never merged by the original author.

Additional features might be added in the future.
